### Responses
All of his reponses are in index.js, but here's some examples:
* "Trying to build a team behind that technology would be a staffing nightmare."
* "That can't be generalized to a cross-platform build."
* "Unfortunately, the license would contaminate our product."
* "Our support infrastructure simply can't handle the volume that change would involve."
* "I had one of the interns try that approach for another project, and it was a disaster."
* "Yes, well, that's just not the way things work in the real world.",
* "I like your idea. Why don't you write up a white paper and we'll review it at the next staff meeting?"

 Changes are welcome, submit a PR. He is not listed on the Slack App Directory, since OAuth is not implemented. Set up to run on Heroku, but you can fork and host wherever.
